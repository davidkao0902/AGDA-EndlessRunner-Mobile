BACKGROUND MUSIC

Create Music folder and put MP3 file into it
Go to any object (can be main camera) add Audio Source component, drag MP3 file into the audio source component.
Turn on Play On Awake and Loop (play over again when finished)

FOR SHOOTING EFFECTS/MOVEMENT EFFECTS OF MAIN SPRITE
//declare fields above 
private AudioSource source;
public AudioClip <clipname>;

//can have multiple clipnames, just make sure to drag MP3 file into the component 
public AudioClip <clipname1>;
public AudioClip <clipname2>;

//in Awake() or Start() make sure to initialize source
source = GetComponent<AudioSource>();

//place this in whenever a key is pressed and in audio source componenet, make sure to drag MP3 file into public field clipname
source.PlayOneShot(<clipname>, <volume>);

//can add randomness to sound with 
private float volLowRange = 0.5f;
private float volHighRange = 1.0f;
float vol = Random.Rang(volLowRange, volHighRange);
source.PlayOneShot(<clipname>, vol);

SOUNDS IN OUR GAME
- bullet firing --> as fire faster pitch increases 
- background music
  --> maybe music can speed up or change to more intense beats when playing the game for longer 
- sprite collision into obstacle
- sprite jumping
- game over sound
- bullet collision into obstacle 
- main menu music
- main menu button interactable music 
- settings menu
  --> for sound off button, need some way to turn off all music 
- perfect landing sound 
- different sound effects could incoporate like (echo, reverb using send and receive effects)
